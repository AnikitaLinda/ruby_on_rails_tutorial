This application was built during a ruby-on-rails tutorial for training purposes only.
For that reason, some functionalities are disabled now.
The project scope was to build an online platform for a fictitious start-up called DevMatch,
composed of HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, using Git, Bootstrap, 
e-commerce tools etc. It features user registration/authentication, user profiles including image upload,
contact form, email notifications, subscription for basic or premium membership and billing.
